	<p style="color: white;">The film deals with this journey as it's main plot. Vendhu Thanindhathu Kaadu is an extension of one of writer Jeyamohan's short stories, and the initial portions of VTK feel exactly like that. Be it the conversations between characters, the slang or the geography, everything looks authentic, and adds something to the story.</p>
